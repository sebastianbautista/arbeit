This repo contains miscellaneous things related to work, mostly one-off Jupyter Notebooks.
* In **0_stata_dta_generation_cre.ipynb**, I convert four Excel files to four Stata .dta files in panel format.
* In **2_LC_desc_topic_modeling_TfIdf_NMF_LDA.ipynb**, I perform topic modeling on Lending Club text data using two different techniques, LDA and NMF, and two distinct input matrices, one with raw token counts and the other weighted using tf-idf.
* In **2_separated_desc_freq_dist_viz.ipynb**, I look at the same Lending Club data, using Yellowbrick to visualize frequency distributions of (1, 4)-grams after subsetting by loan purpose. 
* In **checking_missing_tickers.ipynb**, I compare string variables and cross-check with an outside data source to explain missing values.
* In **regressions_for_programming_club.ipynb**, I go over a few ways to estimate regression models in Python - OLS, cluster-robust OLS, and a two-way fixed effects model, also using two different syntax styles.
